abstract = {Recent empirical studies of firm-level performance have been concerned with establishing potential complementarity between more than two organizational practices. These papers have drawn conclusions on the basis of potentially biased estimates of pair-wise interaction effects between such practices. In this paper we develop a consistent testing framework based on multiple inequality constraints that derives from the definition of (strict) super modularity as suggested by Athey and Stern (1998). Monte Carlo results show that the multiple restrictions test is superior for performance models with high explanatory power. If practices explain only a minor part of organizational performance no test is able to identify complementarity or substitutability in a satisfactory manner.},

abstract = {Despite the trend in investigating combinations of MC practices that form packages or systems, there is ambiguity about what is meant by a "control package" or "control system". In this paper, we address questions related to MC as a package and as a system, both from a conceptual and empirical perspective. The purpose of our study is to clarify a number of issues, so as to guide future research in this area. We do not claim to have all the answers. Rather we make a number of assumptions explicit to show when it is important to address multiple MC practices simultaneously, why this is the case, and what the empirical implications are. Our research directly relates to the systems approach to contingency theory and the literature's struggle to clearly define its most fundamental concept, i.e., "internal consistency". Our analysis provides a formal definition of "internal consistency" and shows how it can be used to conceptualize MC systems, thereby giving contingency theorists the necessary ingredient to move forward. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study examines management control (MC) combinations that are effective in different strategic contexts through two related approaches - MC as a package and MC as a system. First, this study identifies how a set of MC practices combine (i.e. MC packages) to achieve effective control outcomes for firms operating in defender and prospector strategic contexts by applying fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Using data from a survey of top managers the analysis reveals that there are multiple ways by which firms can effectively combine MC practices in a given strategic context. Furthermore, the analysis shows that not all MC practices found to be relevant in isolation are relevant when examined simultaneously as a package. Second, based on a comparison of effective MC packages this study examines interdependencies between MC practices (i.e. MC systems). Results show that in defender firms a diagnostic control use of accounting and mechanistic structural controls act as complements, while mechanistic structural controls and measure diversity act as substitutes. In prospector firms an interactive control use of accounting and organic structural controls are found to have complementary effects. These results indicate that the effectiveness of accounting control and structural control choices are determined not only by their fit with strategic context but also by how they fit with each other. This study also demonstrates how an understanding of MC packages can provide guidance for theory development and empirical analysis of MC systems.},

ABSTRACT Using a sample of 140 managers, we investigate the use of various perfor-mance metrics in determining the periodic assessment, bonus decisions, and career paths of business unit managers. We show that the weight on account-ing return measures is associated with the authority of these managers, and we document that both disaggregated measures (expenses and revenues), and nonfinancial measures play a greater role as interdependencies between business units increase. The results suggest separate and distinct roles for dif-ferent types of performance measures. Accounting return measures are used to create the proper incentives for managers with greater authority, while disaggregated and nonfinancial measures are employed in response to inter-dependencies.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to use the levers of control framework to explore the antecedents of control systems - various facets of strategy that drive the use of controls; to explore the relations among control systems; and to explore the costs and benefits of control systems - costs in terms of consumption of a constrained resource (i.e., management attention) and benefits (i.e., learning). Using data from a survey of 122 Chief Financial Officers, this study tests a structural equation model that relates strategic risk and uncertainty to control systems (i.e., beliefs, boundary, diagnostic, and interactive control systems), which in turn are hypothesized to affect learning and attention, and ultimately firm performance. The evidence suggests that there are multiple inter-dependent and complementary relations among the control systems. I find that strategic risk and uncertainty drive both the importance and use of performance measures in diagnostic or interactive roles. Moreover, it appears that in certain strategic conditions information processing needs are such that firms use performance measures both interactively and diagnostically. Finally, I conclude that although there is a cost of control, there is a positive effect on firm performance. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We test for three-way complementarities among information technology (IT), performance pay, and human resource (HR) analytics practices. We develop a principal-agent model examining how these practices work together as an incentive system that produces a larger productivity premium when the practices are implemented in concert rather than separately. We assess our model by combining fine-grained data on human capital management (HCM) software adoption over 11 years with detailed survey data on incentive systems and HR analytics practices for 189 firms. We find that the adoption of HCM software is greatest in firms that have also adopted performance pay and HR analytics practices. Furthermore, HCM adoption is associated with a large productivity premium when it is implemented as a system of organizational incentives, but has less benefit when adopted in isolation. The system of three-way complements produces disproportionately greater benefits than pairwise interactions, highlighting the importance of including all three complements. Productivity increases significantly when the HCM systems "go live" but not when they are purchased, which can be years earlier. This helps rule out reverse causality as an explanation for our findings. This paper was accepted by Sandra Slaughter, information systems.},

Yet, they do not address traditional goal divergence concerns but rather activate dialogues around meanings to define, negotiate, and legitimize the objectives that emerge during creation. This purpose is achieved through mechanisms that inspire (inspirational controls) these dialogues and mechanisms that configure (directional controls) the way they happen. Our research is based on a multi-case research design structured around an in-depth case study where the main traits of these systems are identified, followed up by five additional cases that reinforce, reshape, and enrich the findings.

We argue that incentive contracts and selection can be both complements and substitutes conditional on the contracting difficulty faced by the firm. We examine these control choices in a setting where contracting difficulties arise due to the firm's choice of strategy and from the volatility created by the firm's external environment. We select a firm's commitment to organizational learning (OL) as our strategic choice variable as this provides a useful proxy for identifying settings where explicit incentive contracting is difficult. The results show that, as firms become increasingly committed to OL, incentive contracts and employee selection operate as complements. However, with a high commitment to OL and an increasing level of external volatility, contracting on performance measures will become less effective. In this context, our results indicate that there)},

The empirical results show that, if financial performance measures are ''good'' (''poor'') incentive measures, i.e., high (low) on sensitivity, precision, and verifiability, then using these measures for in-centive purposes increases (decreases) delegation. Overall, the results are consistent with the argument that firms design their decision-making process around the quality of contractible performance measures.},

We use a structural equation model to investigate whether the extent a firm emphasizes a flexible culture is related to the emphasis placed on beliefs, boundary, diagnostic and interactive controls. We also examine whether a key contingency variable, size, moderates our proposed model. Using survey data from 267 top managers of medium-sized firms, we find, as expected, that the more firms emphasize a flexible culture, the more they emphasize the use of beliefs controls. We show that this finding is robust to firm size. Thus, we conclude that the emphasis placed on beliefs control is an important control mechanism in organizations that emphasize a flexible culture. We also conclude that size moderates the associations among the control levers. Relative to the subsample of smaller firms, in the subsample of larger firms the beliefs and boundary control uses of performance measures are more reinforcing of each other while the diagnostic use of performance measures and boundary control act more as replacements for each other.},

abstract = {Organizations that rely heavily on employee creativity face a dilemma: the particular nature of creative production calls for a substantial use of formal control, yet such control can undermine employee creativity. We examine this dilemma by analyzing how an organization's reliance on creativity influences its choice of control practices. More specifically, we argue that an organization's high reliance on employee creativity generates two types of cost, which will be reflected in the control choices made by its top management. First, a high reliance on employee creativity brings with it particular risks of dysfunctional employee behavior such as an overly narrow focus on the individual task or the opportunistic use of task-specific expertise. Second, it generates costs when it induces organizations to abstain from the use of (otherwise effective) controls because such controls increase the risk of undermining employee creativity. We identify two characteristics of the work setting - the importance of employees' intrinsic task motivation and the lack of task-specific cause-effect knowledge on part of managers - which help us to better understand the sources of the cost of creativity. Using survey data from 457 companies, we provide evidence that the importance managers attach to their employees' intrinsic task motivation is associated with a higher emphasis on assessments of non-task related performance, while a perceived lack of task-specific cause-effect knowledge on the managers' side is associated with more use of predefined targets for performance evaluation. Both work characteristics contribute to explaining higher emphasis on employee selection processes and increased delegation in work settings that heavily rely on employee creativity.},

Using survey data from 233 Business Unit managers, a structural equation model shows that the intensity of use of a LoC system of controls is positively associated with both empowerment and creativity. The implication is that the LoC system provides an environment that is rich with information and motivates employees to take action in directed ways. This environment facilitates employees' perception that they have the ability to take actions, make decisions, and produce novel ideas.

abstract = {This paper studies alternative empirical strategies for estimating the effects of organization design practices on performance, as well as the factors which determine organizational design, in a cross-section of firms. Our economic model is based on a firm where multiple organizational design practices are en endogenously determined, and these organizational design practices affect output through an 'organizational design production function.' The econometric model includes unobserved exogenous variation in the costs and returns to each of the individual practices. The model is used to evaluate how different econometric strategies for testing theories about complementarity can be interpreted under alternative assumptions about the economic and statistical environment. We identify plausible hypotheses about the joint distribution of the unobservables under which several different approaches from the existing literature will yield biased and inconsistent estimates. We show that the sign of the bias depends on two factors: whether the organzational design practices are complements, and the correlation between the unobserved returns to each practice. We find several sets of conditions under which the sign of the bias can be determined, and we provide economic interpretations. Our analysis shows that for a particular set of hypotheses, a variety of different procedures may all yield qualitatively similar biases, presenting a challenge for the identification of complementarity. We then propose a structural approach, which is based on a system of simultaneous equations describing productivity and the demand for organizational design practices. As long as exogenous variables are observed which are uncorrelated with the unobserved returns to practices, the structural parameters are identified, yielding consistent tests for complementarity as well as the cross-equation restrictions implied by static optimization of the organizatin's profit function.},

abstract = {We use survey data to examine firms' propensity to rely on financial measures in evaluating local business unit managers. We find that firms rely less on financial measures (and more on nonfinancial measures or subjective evaluations) in determining local managers' bonuses when those managers have greater influence over the design of internal accounting systems. At the same time, we find no significant association between the choice of performance measures and local managers' authority to make operating decisions. Instead, we find that local authority to make operating decisions is positively associated with local managers' influence over accounting systems. Taken together, our findings suggest that the design of internal accounting systems is an important dimension of overall organizational design. Our findings also cast doubt on the maintained assumption in prior work that major organizational design choices are complementary.

abstract = {ABSTRACT In this study, we examine how firms' collaborative objectives influence their use of performance management practices in interfirm relationships. We conceptualize collaborative performance management to include three interrelated practices: measurement of interfirm performance, information sharing, and interaction between boundary spanners of partner firms. Prior research has related firms' interfirm control choices to transaction risk as proxied by “given” transaction characteristics. We hypothesize that transaction characteristics are determined by the strategic importance of the collaboration (manifested by the importance of firms' collaborative objectives) and, in turn, influence the use of firms' performance management practices. Analysis of survey data supports our hypotheses that strategic importance of the collaboration is associated with transaction characteristics (i.e., with asset specificity, transaction scope, task interdependencies, and environmental variability), which, in turn, me...},

@article{Bedford2015,
abstract = {There is growing interest in how management controls operate together as a package of interrelated mechanisms. Although theoretical debate dates back to the seminal paper of Otley (1980), there remains little empirical analysis of how control mechanisms combine. To increase knowledge in this area this study explores how multiple accounting and other control mechanisms commonly combine and the associations these combinations have with firm context. From a cross-sectional sample of 400 firms, this study presents an empirically derived taxonomy of five control configurations used by top managers, labelled as simple, results, action, devolved, and hybrid. Many of these patterns closely resemble control configurations common to the literature, while others represent distinctively contemporary arrangements, such as flexible variants of traditional bureaucracy (action), and instances where multiple and seemingly conflicting control types intermesh (hybrid). In analyzing these configurations this study provides accounting and control researchers with empirical observations to refine and extend existing control frameworks and theory.},

abstract = {Contingency theories dominate scholarly studies of organization behavior, design, performance, planning and management strategy. While they vary widely in subject matter, they have the common proposition that an organizational outcome is the consequence of a "fit" or match between two or more factors. "Fit" is the key concept in this proposition, and the core problem common to contingency theories is not defining this term clearly. This paper examines three way s to defined and test this concept of fit: Selection, Interaction, and Systems approaches. A critical discussion of these three approaches will clarify much of the current confusion in the literature on contingency theories, and suggest ways that future theorizing and research can become more systematic and constructive.},

In this paper, we take a broader approach to the issue, combining a “productivity” and an “adoption” approach, while including a search for contextual variables in the firm's strategy that affects complementarity. Analysis of contextual variables is not only interesting per se, but also improves the productivity test for the existence of complementarity. We use our empirical methodology to analyze complementarity between innovation activities: internal research and development (R{\&}D) and external knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest that internal R{\&}D and external knowledge acquisition are complementary innovation activities, but that the degree of complementarity is sensitive to other elements of the firm's strategic environment. We identify reliance on basic R{\&}D—the importance of universities and research centers as an information source for the inn...},

We estimate an equilibrium model of profit maximization to evaluate how dealers change their innovation adoption strategies following the elimination of exclusive territories.

Firms view these innovations as substitutes and concentrate their effort in one type of software as they expand their scale of production. Results are robust to the existence of unobserved heterogeneity. (JEL D24, K21, L21, L22, L62, O32)},

abstract = {We argue that contingency research related to management control systems (MCSs) has been impeded by the inherent limitations of the empirical methods employed, and introduce fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) as an alternative empirical method to address these limitations. Using a novel dataset on manufacturing firms and two organizational configurations derived from extant (mostly qualitative) research examining the influence of strategy on control, we demonstrate fsQCA's superiority over traditional quantitative methods for examining relations that are (1) complex in the sense that they involve higher-order interactions; (2) equifinal in the sense that the same outcome can be achieved through different organizational configurations; and (3) asymmetric in the sense that organizational configurations that explain the presence of the outcome are irrelevant for explaining the absence of the outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate how fsQCA can be combined with traditional quantitative methods to produce complementary findings and address problems that are common to empirical research. Overall, our findings demonstrate the usefulness of set-theoretic methods, such as fsQCA, to accounting research.},

@techreport{Athey1998,
abstract = {This paper studies alternative empirical strategies for estimating the effects of organization design practices on performance, as well as the factors which determine organizational design, in a cross-section of firms. Our economic model is based on a firm where multiple organizational design practices are en endogenously determined, and these organizational design practices affect output through an 'organizational design production function.' The econometric model includes unobserved exogenous variation in the costs and returns to each of the individual practices. The model is used to evaluate how different econometric strategies for testing theories about complementarity can be interpreted under alternative assumptions about the economic and statistical environment. We identify plausible hypotheses about the joint distribution of the unobservables under which several different approaches from the existing literature will yield biased and inconsistent estimates. We show that the sign of the bias depends on two factors: whether the organzational design practices are complements, and the correlation between the unobserved returns to each practice. We find several sets of conditions under which the sign of the bias can be determined, and we provide economic interpretations. Our analysis shows that for a particular set of hypotheses, a variety of different procedures may all yield qualitatively similar biases, presenting a challenge for the identification of complementarity. We then propose a structural approach, which is based on a system of simultaneous equations describing productivity and the demand for organizational design practices. As long as exogenous variables are observed which are uncorrelated with the unobserved returns to practices, the structural parameters are identified, yielding consistent tests for complementarity as well as the cross-equation restrictions implied by static optimization of the organizatin's profit function.},
